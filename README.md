# Kinopoisk-Movie-Recommendation-System

The system employs advanced machine learning algorithms, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and a hybrid approach, to predict movies most suitable for a user.

Key Features:
Collaborative Filtering: Uses user-item interaction data (e.g., ratings) to find similar users/items.

Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on metadata (genres, directors, keywords).

Hybrid Model: Combines collaborative and content-based approaches for improved accuracy.

Scalable Architecture: Designed to handle large datasets (e.g., MovieLens 25M).

Evaluation Metrics: RMSE, MAE, Precision@K, and Recall@K for performance analysis.

Technologies & Tools:
Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn)

Surprise (for collaborative filtering)

TensorFlow/Keras (neural network-based models)

Streamlit (interactive demo UI)

Jupyter Notebook (experimentation/analysis)

Dataset:
Kinopoisk Dataset: Contains user ratings and movie metadata.
