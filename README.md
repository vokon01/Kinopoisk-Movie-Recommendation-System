# Kinopoisk-Movie-Recommendation-System

The system employs advanced machine learning algorithms, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and a hybrid approach, to predict movies most suitable for a user.



Key Features:

Collaborative Filtering: Uses user-item interaction data (ratings) to find similar users/items.

Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on metadata (genres, directors, movie description).

Hybrid Model: Combines collaborative and content-based approaches for improved accuracy.

Evaluation Metrics: RMSE, MAE, Precision@10, and Recall@10 for performance analysis.



Technologies & Tools:

Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn)

Surprise (for collaborative filtering)


Bootstrap (interactive demo UI)

Jupyter Notebook (experimentation/analysis)

Dataset:
Kinopoisk Dataset: Contains user ratings and movie metadata.
